# Easy Negative Cases

Regardless of the model, there are four situations which immediately return
invalid LOS that has nothing to do with obstructions.

1. The elevation angle between the two sites is too large (i.e., it should be
   much less than 90 degrees).
2. Both sites are on the same building (generally, such sites can be connected
   by wire).
3. The distance between the sites exceeds the maximum distance (i.e., the
   signal is not sufficiently strong to merit valid LOS).
4. The LOS intersects with exclusion zones.
