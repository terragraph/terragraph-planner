# Terragraph Planner Documentation
The Terragraph planner uses a combination of Geographic Information System (GIS)
data (Clutter/Terrain/SHP files) and hardware information about Terragraph nodes
to generate optimal network topologies for an area of interest.

This directory contains all Terragraph Planner manuals and documentation that can be
used as a reference for developers and operators.
