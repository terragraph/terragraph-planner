# Antenna Front End

A typical antenna subsystem used in a 60 GHz radio equipment has multiple
smaller antennas combining their energies to perform beamforming. A picture
of a sample design is show in Figure 2. The ”beam” formed (as shown in Figure
3) can then be steered to a desired direction. Some systems also have the
capability to create multiple beams each steered to a different direction,
as shown in Figure 4. These are standard features and the TG antenna subsystem
is presumed to possess them.

For the purpose of modeling, the tool requires three categories of input
parameters in order to fully emulate the capabilities described above. Those
files could be added by specifying the file path in the `DeviceData` struct for
each different hardware.

## Single-beam Pattern

A single-beam pattern as shown in Figure 3 is referred to as ”Antenna Pattern
File” in the tool. Antenna Pattern File defines the signal loss in the antenna
in different angles (similar to Planet’s format as .txt file) with 0th degree
being the Boresight gain (dBi). Another input, Horizontal Scan Range (in
degrees) should also be provided, representing the horizontal scan range limit
of the antenna system.

### Common Pattern

Of course, the pattern changes for every steering direction. However, these
changes do not cause significant changes in the overall system performance
and hence ignored in the tool’s modeling. In other words, the tool takes a
common single-beam pattern steered at 0 degrees and rotates (equivalent of
steering) to any desired direction.

### Antenna Deviation

Generally, DNs are expected to be mounted at relatively higher altitudes than
the CNs. Therefore, the DN antennas’ boresight is deviated upwards when
looking towards a CN(negative elevation deviation). Consequently, the CN
antennas’ boresight is deviated downwards when looking towards a DN (positive
elevation deviation). Therefore, the appropriate antenna gains are considered
for RSL and SINR calculations, not the full boresight gains.

The result antenna gain with positive or negative elevation deviation should
also consider the azimuthal deviation adjustments. In the azimuthal axis,
when the two antennas (DN-DN or DN-CN) are not pointing towards each other,
the loss in boresight gain is considered. If the antenna pattern in asymetric,
we consider the positive deviation for a clockwise deviation (in top view) and
negative deviation for an anticlockwise deviation.

## Multi-beam Effects

When multiple beams are employed, such as in a P2MP scenario, there is a limit
is a 1-3 dB loss across the specified scan range. This loss is generally lower
at the angles close to the 0 degree point and can potentially increase at
angles away with increasing angle. Therefore a file defining the signal gain
of the antenna boresight in different scan angles need to be provided as input,
specified as ”Scan Pattern File”

## Multi-sector Capability

Standard TG devices have the flexibility of creating two simultaneous beams
per node. This is shown in Figure 5. These are referred to as Sectors and the
input is specified as "Number Sectors Per Node" referring to number of sectors
in each node.

Note that there is a minimum angular limit in degrees between links on different
radios on the same site connecting to other nodes. The corresponding input is
specified as "Diff Sector Angle Limit".
