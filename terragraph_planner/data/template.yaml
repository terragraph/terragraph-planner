# This file is a template for the configuration yaml file with the default
# values used in the planner, except all the file paths and DEVICE_LIST. Change
# the values to customize the configuration of your own plan.
#
# NOTE:
# 1. BOUNDARY_POLYGON_FILE_PATH is a required field when LOS analysis is run.
# 2. The DEVICE_LIST cannot be empty.
# 3. If any field is deleted, left blank or filled out with "null" or "~", the
#    default value is used. This does not apply to BOUNDARY_POLYGON_FILE_PATH
#    and DEVICE_LIST.
# 4. The default value of each file path is null rather than the string in this
#    template. BASE_TOPOLOGY_FILE_PATH is null here because BASE_TOPOLOGY_FILE_PATH
#    and BUILDING_OUTLINE_FILE_PATH cannot be provided simultaneously.
# 5. The "[Optional]" tag for each field means it can be null and its default
#    Python value is None. Fields without that tag cannot be assigned as null.
# 6. Including a field and leaving its value blank is discouraged. It is better
#    to omit it entirely.
# 7. "None" is treated as a string "None" rather than None type in Python.
#    Please refer to https://yaml.org/ for more information.
#
# Because of how defaults are handled, the input configuration yaml file only
# needs to provide the parameters that are different than the given default.

  AVAILABILITY_SEED: 0

  # [Int] Maximum time in minutes that the computation of availability will run
